# MetaPod 

## What Is MetaPod?

MetaPod is a cross-platform library that allows you to generate personalized portable executables from a base stub. It is capable of doing this while preserving the stub applications digital code signature.

## Some Use Cases 
- Create per-user installers with login tokens embedded in the program. 
- Gain invaluable insight by seeing the real conversion users who visit your site and download an application.
- Insert metadata that allows software to self-configure. 

## Getting Started

TODO

## Language Support
- Go
- C#

Want to help expand this list? You can contribute by writing a wrapper for the C library. 


## Requirements 
- Your stub application must be x32. x64 support is planned.
- The stub application must already have a valid digital signature.
